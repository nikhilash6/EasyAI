"""Build setup/catalog.json - the lockfile EasyAISetup installs from.

    python tools/make_catalog.py

Everything is read from this machine, so the catalogue describes a setup that
demonstrably works rather than one assembled from guesses:

* **ComfyUI's exact commit** and the custom node versions are read from the
  install itself - each checkout's git commit, or a registry pack's
  pyproject.toml version. (ComfyUI-Manager's snapshots were used before, but
  they stop being written when Manager is not loaded and quietly go stale.)
* **Which models and nodes each group needs** comes from EasyAI's own workflow
  files, so the catalogue tracks the workflows automatically.
* **Download URLs** are harvested from ComfyUI's bundled workflow templates
  (their loader nodes carry ``properties.models[].url``) and ComfyUI-Manager's
  model registry, then topped up from setup/url_overrides.json for the files
  neither knows about.

One rule drives the node section: **do not trust /object_info's python_module.**
``comfyui-workflow-encrypt`` re-registers other packs' nodes and gets credited
with them, so a workflow needing ComfyUI-GGUF appears to need the encrypt shim
instead. The owner is found by scanning each pack's source for the class name.
