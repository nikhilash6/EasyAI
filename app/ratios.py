"""Aspect ratio -> pixel dimensions, per model family.

Two mechanisms, because image and video models want different things:

* **Image engines** use a solver: hold the pixel budget (megapixels) roughly
  constant, preserve the ratio as exactly as possible, and snap both sides to
  the engine's required multiple. This is the same idea as the
  `ResolutionSelector` custom node (ratio + megapixels + multiple) already used
  in the MiniMax workflow.

* **Video engines** use an explicit ladder. Video models are trained on a short
  list of resolutions and arbitrary sizes cost quality and VRAM, so guessing is
  worse than looking the answer up.

Adding a model is one entry in ENGINES (plus a LADDERS entry if it's video).
