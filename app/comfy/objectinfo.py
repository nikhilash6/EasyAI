"""Answers "will this workflow actually run here?" before the user clicks it.

This is the reason EasyAI exists. A workflow that names a custom node the user
never installed, or a model file they never downloaded, fails deep inside
ComfyUI and surfaces as a stack trace. Here the same problem is caught up front
and named: *"Needs add-on: ComfyUI-GGUF"*.

Everything is derived from ``GET /object_info``, which lists every node type the
running ComfyUI knows about, and - for loader nodes - the exact list of model
files it can see:

    object_info["UnetLoaderGGUF"]["input"]["required"]["unet_name"][0]
      -> ["Flux 2\\flux-2-klein-9b-Q8_0.gguf", "QWEN\\...", ...]
