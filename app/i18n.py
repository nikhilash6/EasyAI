"""Translating the interface, without turning the source into puzzle pieces.

Strings are looked up by their English text rather than by an invented key:

    label.setText(t("Generate"))

That choice costs a little at lookup time and buys a lot everywhere else. The
source stays readable, a missing translation falls back to perfectly good
English instead of showing "ui.button.generate" to a user, and a translator
can work from a file where both halves are sentences.

Catalogues live in lang/<code>.json as a flat {english: translated} map, so
adding a language means adding one file - no code change, and no build step of
the kind Qt's own .ts/.qm pipeline would need.

Both EasyAI and EasyAI Setup import this. It holds no Qt dependency and no
reference to either program's settings, so neither owns it.
