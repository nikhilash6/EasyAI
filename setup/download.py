"""Downloading very large files without losing work.

A 27 GB model over a domestic connection takes hours, and something will
interrupt it. Three rules follow from that:

* **Resume, never restart.** Bytes land in ``<name>.part``; a second attempt
  asks the server to continue from wherever that file stopped.
* **Never rename an unfinished file.** The final name appears only once the
  size (and hash, when the catalogue has one) checks out, so a half-downloaded
  model can never look installed.
* **Say what is happening.** Speed and time remaining, because "wait several
  hours" is only tolerable when it is visibly progressing.
