"""The install itself, as a sequence of resumable steps.

Every step checks whether its work is already done before doing it, so an
install interrupted at 80% carries on from 80% rather than starting again. The
state file written at the end records what succeeded, which is what makes a
second run cheap.

Everything is written inside the destination folder the user chose, with one
deliberate exception: the last step writes EasyAI's settings.json so the viewer
does not finish a multi-hour install and then have to type a path in by hand.
That file is merged, never replaced.
